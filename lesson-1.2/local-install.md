## 🛠️ Setup Checklist

So far, you've been working in a cloud-based development tool in the browser called GitHub Codespaces. For this lesson Pygame works best when run locally on a computer, this requires you to use Visual Studio Code and cloning your repository.

**Step 1: Get Python**
- Go to the Windows Store and install **Python 3.13**
- OR open the command line and type `python` (it'll take you to the installation page automatically!)

**Step 2: Download Your Code Editor**
- Download and install **Visual Studio Code** from the Windows Store
- This will be your game development headquarters!

**Step 3: Connect to Your Project**
- Open Visual Studio Code
- Go to **Source Control** > **Clone** (under the three dots)
- Follow the instructions to fork and clone the repository
- Now you have your own copy to work with!

**Step 4: Add Your AI Coding Assistant**
- In VS Code, click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar
- Search for **"GitHub Copilot"** and install it
- Your AI pair programmer is now ready to help!

**Step 5: Add Python Support**
- Still in Extensions, search for **"Python"** and install it
- This gives VS Code superpowers for Python development

**Step 6: Test Everything Works**
