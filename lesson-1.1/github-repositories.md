# GitHub Repositories: The Basics

## Introduction to repositories

Let's first review:

- What is a repository?
- How to create a repository
- Adding files to a repository
- How to search for repositories
- Introduction to gists, wikis, and GitHub pages

### What is a repository?

A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. It's one of the essential parts that helps you collaborate with people. You can use repositories to manage your work, track changes, store revision history, and work with others. Before we dive too deep, let's first start with how to create a repository.

### How to create a repository

You can create a new repository on your personal account or any organization where you have sufficient permissions.

Let's tackle creating a repository from github.com.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the drop-down menu, and select **New repository**.

1. Use the **Owner** drop-down menu to select the account you want to own the repository.

1. Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.

1. Choose a repository visibility.

    - **Public repositories** are accessible to everyone on the internet.

    - **Private repositories** are only accessible to you, people you explicitly share access with, and, for organization repositories, certain organization members.

1. Select **Create repository** and congratulations! You just created a repository!

Next up, let's review how to add files to your repository.

### How to add a file to your repository

Files in GitHub can do a handful of things, but the main purpose of files is to store data and information about your project. It's worth knowing in order to add a file to a repository that you must first have minimum **Write** access within the repository you want to add a file.

Let's review how to add a file to your repository.

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
1. In your repository, browse to the folder where you want to create a file by selecting the **creating a new file** link or **uploading an existing file**.
1. Once added, above the list of files select the **Add file ·êÅ** drop-down menu. Then select **Create new file**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/add-file-options.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the option to add a file to your new repository highlighted in red with the add file button towards the right of the screen." border="false":::

1. In the file name field, type the name and extension for the file. To create subdirectories, type the **/** directory separator.
1. In the file contents text box, type **content** for the file.
1. To review the new content, above the file contents, select **Preview**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-preview-option-in-a-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a yml file with the preview button highlighted in the top left." border="false":::

1. Select **Commit changes**.
1. In the **Commit message** field, type a short and meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message.
1. If you have more than one email address associated with your account on GitHub.com, select the email address drop-down menu. Then select the email address to use as the Git author email address. Only verified email addresses appear in this drop-down menu. If you enabled email address privacy, then *[username]@users.noreply.github.com* is the default commit author email address.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-commit-description-box.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a commit change with a description box and the drop-down menu of the email to select as the author of the commit." border="false":::

1. Below the **Commit message** fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit, and then create a pull request.

     :::image type="content" source="../media/2-create-a-new-branch.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing creating a new branch from a commit option select with the textbox of the new branch below it." border="false":::

1. Select **Commit changes** or **Propose changes**.

Congratulations, you just created a new file in your repository! You have also created a new branch and made a commit.

Before we review branches and commits in the next unit, let's quickly review gists, wikis, and GitHub pages because they're similar to repositories.

### What are gists

Now that we have a good understanding of repositories, we can review gists. Similarly to repositories, gists are a simplified way to share code snippets with others.

Every gist is a Git repository, which you can fork and clone and be made either public or secret. Public gists are displayed publicly where people can browse new ones as they're created. Public gists are also searchable. Conversely, secret gists aren't searchable, but they aren't entirely private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it.

To learn more about gists, see the linked article in our Resources section at the end of this module titled *Creating Gists*.

### What are wikis?

Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles. While a README file quickly tells what your project can do, you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation.

It's worth a reminder that if your repository is private, only people who have at least read access to your repository will have access to your wiki.
