In this exercise, you’ll use GitHub Copilot to create a basic webpage! We want to create a website that allows students to signup for additional coaching for our program. A few requirements we were given:

- Students should enter their basic information(Name, Email, etc.)
- Students must be able to see a list of multiple options they would like to request tutoring(Python Programming, Web Design, Startup Ideas, College Application, etc.)
- Students should be able to enter their preferred days and times for coaching

### Steps
1. You’ll first need to decide what your webpage should look like. You’ll want to keep it fairly simple for this first time. Some things to note:
    - Do some research on some similar websites for inspiration.
    - If you want to learn how people create wireframes of websites, check out this article by [Skillcrush: Website Wireframe 101](https://skillcrush.com/blog/website-wireframe/)


2. Next, you'll need to sketch your webpage. There are different ways to do this, here are some options:
    - **Pen and Paper**: Draw your webpage on a piece of paper and take a picture with your phone
    - **Phone/Tablet Drawing**: Use a free drawing app like:
      - Notes app (iPhone/iPad) - Just use your finger to draw!
      - Google Keep (Android) - Has a drawing feature built in
    - **Simple Online Tools** (no signup required):
      - [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - Free, no login needed, just start drawing!
      - [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) - Drag and drop shapes to create your layout
    - **Remember**: This is just a rough sketch! Think of it like drawing a blueprint - it doesn't need to be pretty, just show where things go
    - **Upload your sketch**: Once you have your drawing, save it as an image (like .png or .jpg). Then in your Codespace, right-click on the `lesson-1.3/tutor-signup` folder and select "Upload..." to add your sketch file

3.  Create your UI in Home.html
    - Open GitHub Copilot Chat using one of these methods:
      - Press Ctrl+I on your keyboard
      - Look for the Copilot icon in the activity bar
      - Click "View" in the top menu, then find "Chat"
    - Add your sketch to the chat by clicking the paperclip icon and selecting your uploaded image
    - Write a prompt like: "Based on this sketch, create HTML code for a tutoring signup form with [describe your layout]"
    - Copy the generated code into your Home.html file
    - Continue to refine until you get your initial design working

4.  If you noticed, maybe Copilot created everything in the home.html page.  
    - How can you make it better by creating some of the button click or other logic in python?
    - Continue to iterate on the design.  What additional functionality could you add to make it better?
    - What other things should you consider?

**When you are done, make sure to check-in code to your repository. (Hint - maybe Copilot could help you!)**
